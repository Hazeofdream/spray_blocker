# Spray blocker
A Garry's Mod Program to block Sprays

# Information
This is a program dedicated to blocking Sprays, This is for when you want to block sprays from specific people without disabling sprays entirely.
This was made for Sunrust in particular but it can work for any source game that saves the sprays locally.

# Compiling
This is originally a powershell script, but that's ugly and wont run on anyones systems without enabling locally unsigned scripts, So i convert it to an executable using (Win-PS2EXE)[github.com/MScholtes/Win-PS2EXE]
